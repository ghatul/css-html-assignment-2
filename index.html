            <p>I fall into the last generation of people who remember life before the internet. While I may have
                used an
                AOL family account when I was still in high school, it wasn’t until junior year of college that I
                registered for my own email address. (Email was so brand new to the university I attended that,
                while I
                was too late to the registrar to snatch the username jen@, I was still early enough to request and
                receive jenjen@.)
                In this snail-mail letter to Steph, which I never ended up sending, I wrote with exaggerated
                excitement
                about how we would now be able to email each other and avoid long-distance call charges. Over winter
                break earlier that year, I had visited Steph at her home in Yardley, PA where she showed me her
                computer
                station in the finished basement and demonstrated what she meant by “chatting” online with strangers
                (particularly fellow fans of Seinfeld and Friends). I must have realized it then, but truly it
                wasn’t
                until years later that I understood how those chat rooms were her lifeline that winter. How
                strangers on
                the internet, for the last months of Stephanie’s life, must have kept her connected to her humanity.

            <p>Friends who were so close to you both that they struggled with which of you to counsel when it became
                clear you were likely headed toward separation, friends who cried real tears — on behalf of themselves
                and their children — when you told them you were leaving.
                The irony of leaving this kibbutz in northern Israel that felt like home is that I was headed back to
                the town I grew up in, a town I hadn’t ever lived in as an adult, and a town that, in all honesty, never
                really felt like home.</p>
